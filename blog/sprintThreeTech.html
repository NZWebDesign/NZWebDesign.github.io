            HTML and CSS - Through the eyes of a Rabbit
          </h3>

              >HTML and CSS - Through the eyes of a Rabbit</span
            >
            This tale starts once upon a time, as all good stories start, and
            sees a young rabbit hopping its way into a field. The sun was low in
            the sky, being the middle of winter, the lands were covered in snow.
            The days were bleak, a chill wind blew from the east, and not a
            creature could be seen in the vast landscape. <br /><br />
            At the edge of the field stood a solitary tree, and Rabbit noticed
            it barren of leaves, while its tall leafless branches reached high
            into the sky above the snow white field. The rabbit hardly gave the
            tree a second thought, it wasn't much to behold, with it's lifeless
            branches, devoid of leaves, appearing almost dead. <br /><br />
            But slowly the days grew longer, the sun warmed, and the snow
            melted. The tree began to transform too. Leaves appeared, lush and
            green as the sun warmed the landscape. The tree branched out in all
            directions, and more and more leaves filled the branches. One day
            Rabbit noticed small diamonds of colour appear on the tree as it
            began to flower, unlike any ordinary tree these flowers were
            multitudes of colour, cascading down the tree, top to bottom, in all
            the colours of the rainbow. <br />
            <br />
            Rabbit, well versed in website design thought of a similarity
            between HTML and CSS, the bare tree, with no form, variety, or
            colour to it represented the HTML structure, the sun came along and
            worked it's magic applying CSS to the tree, which grew in colour,
            form, life, and layout of leaves and flowers. The CSS applied by the
            sun transformed the tree into a wonderful creation.

          <h3 class="headerPadding">Control Flow and Loops</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="mobileHeader">Control Flow and Loops</span>
            Control flow and loops relate to the order in which javascript code
            is executed. JavaScript executes from top to bottom,and loops are
            used in programming to control the flow of a programme. An if else
            statement is an example that controls the flow of a programme. A
            condition is checked, and if the condition is met it will exit the
            statement. Otherwise it will continue to the next condition to be
            checked. <br /><br />

            An example of control flow and loops from everyday life can be taken
            from how we make decisions during the day. In the morning we wake up
            and we come to the first decision - Am I still tired, can I sleep
            in, or do I have to get up? If I'm tired, and don't have to get out
            of bed, I will sleep some more. Otherwise I will get out of bed. The
            next decision is whether I need to eat breakfast. Am I hungry? Yes,
            in which case I will eat breakfast versus no, so I might skip
            breakfast today. It's then time to get dressed so I check if it's
            hot outside. If the day looks promising I'll throw on a T - Shirt
            and Shorts, otherwise I'll dress for Wellington weather with a
            couple of layers of clothes. If I get outside and it's still feeling
            cold, I might repeat the layering of clothes and throw a super warm
            jacket on. There are many examples throughout the day of control of
            flow and looping. The same principle is used in programming.

            <span class="mobileHeader">The DOM</span>
            The Document Object Model (DOM) lets us interact with web pages. We
            can change the content, add content and delete content via the DOM.
            The document is the webpage itself, and the objects are the elements
            which include tags such as headers, paragraphs, the body, lists etc.
            Elements can be accesed with JavaScript to manipulate them. The
            Model aspect of the DOM just describes how the Webpage, and objects
            are laid out in a tree like fashion.

          <h3 class="headerPadding">Arrays and Objects</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="mobileHeader">Arrays and Objects</span> Arrays are
            lists of items or collections of data. Each item in an array can be
            accessed using brackets. Arrays are indexed lists of data, and each
            data item will have a corresponding number. You may have an array of
            your favourite animals - var favAnimals= ["cats", "birds", "dogs",
            "fish"] With arrays being zero based you would access "birds" in
            your array by typing favAnimals[1]. <br /><br />
            Objects contain properties which you can access in two ways - dot
            notation or bracket notation. Using dot notation you could access
            properties in the following way - myObject.favouriteAnimal, and
            using brackets myObject["favouriteAnimal"].

          <h3 class="headerPadding">Functions</h3>
          <p>
            <span class="mobileHeader">Functions</span> Instead of repeating the
            same piece of code over and over, it can often be written as a
            function. The function is then called whenever you want to use this
            code. A function is a name for a piece of code which you can "call"
            whenever you wish to use the code. Instead of repeatedly writing
            code to perform a task, the code can be written once, and this code
            can take different values. <br /><br />
            So a function can include parameters that it can take, or have
            passed in. The 'arguments' are the actual values that are passed in.
            We could write a function to multiply two numbers, so this functions
            parameters will accept two numbers. The arguments can be any two
            numbers that we wish to multiply. When we want to multiply our
            numbers, we 'call' the function and pass in the 'parameters- the two
            numbers. The function will do the multiplication and 'return' our
            answer.
