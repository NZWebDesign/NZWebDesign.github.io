          <h3>Core personal values...</h3>
          <p>
            The following in no particular order are core personal values, which
            I have established by talking to others and reflecting on my ideals.
            I believe I am an honest person. I also respect this attribute in
            other people, as I think that these days in this world people are
            quick to be dishonest. Trustworthiness is another core value. Being
            trusted and honest I feel are very important core values for a
            person to have. I'm also reliable, helpful and friendly - many
            people have commented to me that I'm easy going and easy to talk to.
            I like to be low maintenance and easy going.
          </p>

          <h3>Ethical decisions...</h3>
          <p>
            This story begins once upon a time, as all good stories do, although
            not in a galaxy far far away, but in a city I lived in a few years
            ago. One friend of mine was offered a job in a cafe / takeaway, sole
            charge, and the owner of the business was an acquaintance of his.
            Not a close friend, but they often caught up for a drink and catch
            up. The acquaintance, Mr A for short, said to my friend that he
            could help himself to any food or meals as he needed, since he was
            often there working long days from 5am. However, this soon stretched
            to my friend making takeaways for all of us, our other friends which
            was a reasonable sized group of people. We could basically help
            ourself to any food in the cafe at any time. I began to wonder if
            the owner actually knew how much food was not being sold to
            customers, and how it was impacting the profit. I purposely stopped
            partaking of the free food, but others continued. I don't think that
            Mr A went into the business knowing how to run a business properly
            for starters, but in saying that, it could have been pointed out to
            him that allowing all these people to help themselves was not going
            to be good for profit. Given that we were just out of high school at
            the time, we propbably didn't think much of it. But looking back on
            it, the ethical decisions would involve telling the group of friends
            that constantly helping ourselves to the food, even though we were
            supposedly allowed to, would impact the business profit negatively.
            Telling the other people this could put you on the outter, as for
            some people this would seem pretty good - free food. But not
            stopping the free food going out could put the business under. As it
            turned out, the owner found the business wasn't profitable, and sold
            it for a loss. The lack of strictness on allowing the 'help yourself
            policy' would not have helped. At the time, there was very little
            thought given to values, or decision making. Making a good ethical
            decision in this instance would probably include not taking much of
            the free food, or none altogether, and alerting the owner to the
            fact that all this free food going out the doors would harm the
            business.

          <h3>Culture...</h3>
          <p>
            My culture is based on Christianity, and I live by the values of
            Christianity, in particular the traditional Catholic Faith, which
            includes the Mass said in Latin as it was pre the 1960's when the
            second Vatican council attempted to alter much of the faith.
          </p>

          <h3>Strengths...</h3>
          <p>
            My strengths include reliability, resiliance and creativeness. I
            think I have good organisational skills, and the ability to make
            plans, and see them through. However, I'm also open to changing the
            plans as progress is made. I'm hardworking and dependable, I enjoy
            working on my own but also work just as well as part of a team.
          </p>
          <h3>Limitations...</h3>
          <p>
            I often hear that inner voice telling me I can't do this,
            particularly if I see other people ahead of me, who seem to gave
            grasped a concept quicker. However, I also know that once I've
            understood the concept, then I can do just as well, and often
            better. I do like to keep things pretty relaxed and chill these
            days, perhaps some people might see this as not taking things
            serious enough.
          </p>
          <h3>Resistance and tension in the ranks...</h3>
          <p>
            There was a time I where I was one of a few people leading a large
            group. An opportunity arose that a few of us saw as beneficial for
            all the group. However, it would require a lot of hard work and
            committment over an extended period. While a few of us could see how
            awesome the opportunity would be, and were prepared to put in the
            work, there are always some in the group who will see the negatives
            and be resistant. (Which is also a good thing) It took a bit of
            convincing and hard work to get the others on board with the idea. A
            number of times some of us left, in a 'not so happy state' with the
            other people who were resistant. There really wasn't much diplomacy
            at the time and it could have been handled better. We found that a
            lot of people easily came on board with the idea anyway. But it
            created unnecessary tension with the others. A better way would have
            involved getting a core group of keen people together, and coming up
            with a plan, or solid direction on how the goal could be achieved,
            and then presenting it to everyone else and asking for feedback.
            This may have been a better way to bring others who might be
            resistant on board with the project.
