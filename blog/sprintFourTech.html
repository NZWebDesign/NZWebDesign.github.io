            So, what was the problem I hear you ask.... Well there was a time,
            actually it's happened many times, when the code threw an error. Ok
            no worries I thought. Code's looking good, should be an easy fix.
            Checking the error log in the console tells you what line the error
            is on, and often the thing, the word, the item, that is causing the
            error, and sure enough it pointed to a function being the source of
            the error. <br /><br />
            I guessed I'd written it the wrong way, or perhaps used square
            brackets when it was supposed to be curley braces or something
            similar. However, after looking over the function it did still look
            good. Next step was to go to google and just check that I really was
            actually writing it with the correct syntax. Yip, still looks good.
            <br /><br />
            Ok, so this is getting a bit annoying and weird. Back to the error
            message and read it again. No more clues there. Hmmm stuck. Do I
            really need this function or shall I just delete it? ... No, it's
            gotta stay! In that case I'm off to grab a coffee. <br /><br />
            A few minutes later, with a fresh cup of coffee and prepared for the
            long haul we set about trouble shooting again. The problem is,
            everything in the function is definitely correct. Then, hold on a
            sec, I've experienced this before. Check the code around it... and
            there it is. In this case a comma missing from code on the line
            prior to the function. <br /><br />So, it's a problem that's
            happened before, and will no doubt happen again. It's often one of
            those very frustrating problems, because the code you think is
            causing the error looks correct, and in fact is correct. It really
            starts to get to you, because the 'stupid code' should be working!!
            The take away from this has to be... look at the code as a whole,
            look at the code around it, and check how the code around it is
            interacting with the code causing the error. Look out for those
            commas and end of lines...

            <span class="mobileHeader">Solving problems elegantly</span>
            Solving problems elegantly involves having a 'go to' process when
            you hit that brick wall. The most elegant way I've solved a problem
            in coding, would be when I went straight to google, and the solution
            was answered for me with a quick google search in an easy to
            understand answer. However, it doesn't always happen like this, so
            the best way to solve problems elegantly is to gave a plan. This
            includes checking the error messages, using console.log(), doing a
            google search, and talking to the rubber duck.
            <br /><br />
            Once the problem is solved, it's always good to reflect on the
            experience, and it should help in the future when faced with similar
            problems. Taking notes is another great way to keep tabs on
            solutions. Write it down to refer to in the future. As well as
            creating a great resource, the act of writing it aids in reflection.
