            Neuroplasticity is the concept that the brain is malleable, it can
            adopt new ideas, new habits, and learn new things over time. Neuro
            refers to the neurons which are the nerves in the brain and these
            have the ability to make new connections and pathways. Plasticity
            refers to the idea of being malleable. <br /><br />
            People who understand that the brain can make new connections, that
            it can build new pathways, are people who will be open to the idea
            that they can learn new tasks, new ideas, and achieve their goals.
            <br /><br />
            Rather than being stuck in a mindeset that they are too old to
            learn, or that they are not clever enough to learn something, those
            people who accept neuroplasticity and the research findings will be
            open to learning and improving themselves.

            How can neuroplasticity benefit me? Neuroplasticity can benefit
            anyone and everyone. It's especially worthwhile understanding this
            if you're taking on new and exciting challenges. <br /><br />
            Positive learning environments, challenges, repetition, as well as
            rest and exercise are all key factors when seeking the benefits of
            neuroplasticity. Revision is important, and using the new ideas that
            you've learned will help to form new connections in the brain.

            <span class="mobileHeader">Growth Mindset</span>
            A person who has a fixed mindest believes that they cannot change,
            they cannot learn new things and they think that they are stuck with
            the abilities they have been given. In contrast to this, someone
            with a growth mindset is open to the malleableness of the brain, and
            the concept that they can form new connections in the brain, new
            pathways, and in doing so learn new, exciting, and challenging
            concepts both mental and physical. <br /><br />
            When leaning new things it is important to come to the challenge
            with a growth mindset. The more you practise a task, and build on
            the task, the better you will become at it, and you will be able to
            add more and more learning on top of this. <br /><br />
            I have found this to be true since I started learning HTML and CSS a
            year ago, slowly adding in more and more, building on the
            foundations I created. I think this is a key concept to becoming a
            web developer or software engineer - your success depends on having
            a growth mindset, on practising your skills everyday, trying new
            things, and building on the foundations you have, no matter how
            basic they may be.
