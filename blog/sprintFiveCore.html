              Values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming...
            </h4>
            <p>
              You've got to be able to get along with other people when you're
              in a learning or programming environment. People have different
              values, and regardless of your values and their values, you still
              need to be able to get along with them and get the job done.
              Empathy is important, as you can't just charge in and expect the
              other people in your team to be on the same page as you. They may
              have things going on in their lives which mean they are not in the
              best zone, and you've got to be able to recognise that and work
              with it. This leads on to self awareness, being aware to the fact
              that perhaps you went charging on into the work zone without
              consideration that your team mates dog just passed away, they're
              not in the work zone obviously, yet you displayed no self
              awareness to the fact that you just went straight into work mode
              and expected them to do the same.

              I don't recall there being anything terribly surprising in the

              would be my 'go to' surprise to write about...

            What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?
          </h4>

            A lot of the core learning was interesting, the challenging aspects
            would be trying to feel motivated to do this sort of thing for the
            millionth time. The most challenging would be around identity and
            values exploration, for two reasons. 1) being the "here we go again"
            doing this sort of thing seems to be commonplace everytime you
            embark on some new tertiary or learning course. and 2) I'm quite
            happy with where I am in life, I know what I value, what my identity
            is, and the 'here we go again' comes into play, as I'm not going to
            be changing my identity or values.

            Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time

            There'd be plenty of people out there who are quite happy beavering
            away on the laptop in their dark bedroom turning out code that NASA
            would be proud of, yet those same people often lack the skills to
            get their code to NASA. They often lack human interaction skills,
            the ability to communicate, the ability to work in a team. These
            days, it's all about the customer, you need to be able to work with
            the customer, communicate with the customer, and hear the customer.
            From an employers point of view, I'd rather employ someone with very
            basic coding ability, but who is personable, who is friendly and
            professional, and who is open to learning, and can demonstrate that
            they are teachable, the person that knows that they don't know
            everything...

            Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a
            waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising
            programming instead? Justify your answer.

          <p>

            Some of it was repetitious in that I've done plenty of this sort of
            thing already. However, I wouldn't say it was a waste of time, as it
            didn't use up much time. There were definitely aspects that were
            worth doing, the refreshers on Neuroplasticity and how people learn,
            and this is something I've been interested in for years anyway. It
            draws me back to high school when we had
            <a href="https://www.taolearn.com/about-us/" target="_blank"

            do workshops with us, and I still recall and use many takeaways from
            his workshops.
