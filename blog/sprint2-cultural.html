          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            The ultimate goal would be to be able to work remotely in website
            development or software engineering. Work that I can do while
            travelling would be ideal, which could be contract work or
            part-time. Initially, any jobs in the industry would be good, and
            for starting off it would probably be quite good to work with others
            in an office environment, or a few days a week in the office, with
            other more experienced people to bounce ideas off.
          </p>

          <h3>
            A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
            learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            My strengths include reliability, resiliance and creativeness. I
            think I have good organisational skills, and the ability to make
            plans, and see them through. However, I'm also open to changing the
            plans as progress is made. I'm hardworking and dependable, I enjoy
            working on my own but also work just as well as part of a team.
            <br /><br />
            I often hear that inner voice telling me I can't do this,
            particularly if I see other people ahead of me, who seem to gave
            grasped a concept quicker. However, I also know that once I've
            understood the concept, then I can do just as well, and often
            better. I do like to keep things pretty relaxed and chill these
            days, perhaps some people might see this as not taking things
            serious enough.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at EDA?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The ability to be confident as a web developer or programmer and I'd
            like to be more confident at job interviews. A recent phone
            interview for a developer job saw me really nervous, and I think
            this definitely came through in my phone manner.
          </p>

          <h3>
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            This should include:
          </h3>
          <h4>
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
            representatives
          </h4>
          <p>
            I'll continue as I would normally in life. I've worked in plenty of
            teams, with different learners, and in groups with people from many
            different backgrounds and experiences, with facilitators, and
            community leaders. I don't see this as being any different to those
            situations, in which I've always managed to work successfully and
            positively both in roles as a learner, and facilitator.
          </p>
          <h4>
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
            you
          </h4>
          <p>
            It takes a <em>lot</em> for things to <em>'get to me.'</em> However,
            on the odd occassion that something may have worked me up, I find
            the best thing to do is just go and take a break. It's easy enough
            to say in a friendly manner, "Oh wow, I need to get a break, back in
            a bit..." Grab a quick walk outside and then get back to it. And
            regardless - it's best to take regular breaks after an amount of
            work - 30 to 40 mins of work.
          </p>
          <h3>
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think I've got a good grasp on asking Google for help initially.
            After that, I find it easy enough to reach out to others on the
            course, and to tutors facilitators. I also think that EDA makes it
            quite easy to be able to do this, to reach out for help when you're
            stuck.
          </p>
          <h3>description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            Feedback, and guidance and feedback on 'what is best practise' in
            this industry.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau
            commitments like school drop-offs. Itâ€™s important to plan these in.
          </h3>
          <p>
            No specific committments, although friends, family, and time for
            myself to recharge are important things to me. However, I'm pretty
            good at scheduling time for work, and time out, And everything in
            between.
          </p>
          <h3>
            These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this
            list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are
            most clearly communicated.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy being creative, and re-structuring things, but I feel in
            this case for the purpose of the task, and clarity, answering in a
            list type fashion works really well for me.
