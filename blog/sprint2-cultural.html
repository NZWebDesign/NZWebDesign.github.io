          <h2>Update at end of sprint 5</h2>
          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            Long term plans remain the same... Long term goal is the ability to
            work remotely. Preference is building websites, but I'm also
            enjoying the JavaScript side of it and making things happen using
            JavaScript code. Destination... long term, a company that works
            remotely, or allows a mix of office work time and remote work time.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
            Bootcamp? Re-evaluate your strengths and limitations from Sprint 2.
            Has your idea of these changed over the course of Foundations? Have
            you discovered any new ones during this course? How do you think
            these will help/hinder you during Bootcamp?
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think my identified strengths from Sprint two have been pretty
            much correct, and have helped me throughout foundations. For
            bootcamp I'd add - Strengths- my easy goingness. I like to just go
            with the flow, and I think this helps me to be able to work with
            anyone and everyone. Limitations – grasping maths concepts and
            difficult logic flow when it is abstract. If you can turn it into
            things that aren't numbers, such as words or pictures I'm good to
            go.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp
            will be? While you will face many technical challenges on Bootcamp,
            this is not what we would like you to consider in this Plan.
            Non-technical challenges might include staying on top of the
            material, working in groups, speaking in front of the group, or
            keeping focused for 9 weeks, etc. \
          </h3>
          <p>
            Non tech challenges- I don't like speaking in front of big groups
            sometimes, other times I find I have no problem with this. I think
            the days will be quite long, it's going to be full on, although the
            break in the middle of the day should be a good refresher.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at EDA? At Dev Academy we have a large
            focus around human skills and improving yourself. Based on your
            strengths/limitations, what are some areas for development you would
            like to work on? For example, this could be things around
            communication, teamwork within groups, pairing with others, giving
            and receiving feedback, developing some leadership skills, or
            improving your self awareness and reflective skills.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I'd like to improve my skills for job interview situations. To be
            confident and not overly nervous in job interviews.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team? What does support
            look like to you? Keep in mind, this may not be the same as the
            Bootcamp team's expectations, but it is useful to voice these
            expectations.
          </h3>

          <p>
            Links to resources, pointers in the right directions, conveying a
            sense of what happens in the real software /website development
            world.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp Based on your
            knowledge of Bootcamp, how and where will you seek help in a timely
            way? I'd ask the other people on the bootcamp course, and then if
            that didn't help I'd ask a facilitator. Write down a commitment to
            how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should
            include - an explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
            productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and
            industry/community representatives.
          </h3>
          <p>
            The key to this is to stay on top of the workload. If you don't
            understand something, ask for clarification, because if you don't –
            then the learning that follows on from this is also not going to be
            understood. Notetaking is good, and revision of notes, as well as
            thinking over the days learning at the end of the day. Aim to learn
            something new every day and at the end of the day, reflect on the
            new points you've learned. Other than this, common sense things
            apply, like turning up on time and working well with the team.

          <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
          <p>
            The ultimate goal would be to be able to work remotely in website
            development or software engineering. Work that I can do while
            travelling would be ideal, which could be contract work or
            part-time. Initially, any jobs in the industry would be good, and
            for starting off it would probably be quite good to work with others
            in an office environment, or a few days a week in the office, with
            other more experienced people to bounce ideas off.
          </p>

          <h3>
            A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to
            learning
          </h3>
          <p>
            My strengths include reliability, resiliance and creativeness. I
            think I have good organisational skills, and the ability to make
            plans, and see them through. However, I'm also open to changing the
            plans as progress is made. I'm hardworking and dependable, I enjoy
            working on my own but also work just as well as part of a team.
            <br /><br />
            I often hear that inner voice telling me I can't do this,
            particularly if I see other people ahead of me, who seem to gave
            grasped a concept quicker. However, I also know that once I've
            understood the concept, then I can do just as well, and often
            better. I do like to keep things pretty relaxed and chill these
            days, perhaps some people might see this as not taking things
            serious enough.
          </p>

          <h3>
            What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see
            developed in yourself while at EDA?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The ability to be confident as a web developer or programmer and I'd
            like to be more confident at job interviews. A recent phone
            interview for a developer job saw me really nervous, and I think
            this definitely came through in my phone manner.
          </p>

          <h3>
            A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.
            This should include:
          </h3>
          <h4>
            An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively
            and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community
            representatives
          </h4>
          <p>
            I'll continue as I would normally in life. I've worked in plenty of
            teams, with different learners, and in groups with people from many
            different backgrounds and experiences, with facilitators, and
            community leaders. I don't see this as being any different to those
            situations, in which I've always managed to work successfully and
            positively both in roles as a learner, and facilitator.
          </p>
          <h4>
            What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to
            you
          </h4>
          <p>
            It takes a <em>lot</em> for things to <em>'get to me.'</em> However,
            on the odd occassion that something may have worked me up, I find
            the best thing to do is just go and take a break. It's easy enough
            to say in a friendly manner, "Oh wow, I need to get a break, back in
            a bit..." Grab a quick walk outside and then get back to it. And
            regardless - it's best to take regular breaks after an amount of
            work - 30 to 40 mins of work.
          </p>
          <h3>
            A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way
          </h3>
          <p>
            I think I've got a good grasp on asking Google for help initially.
            After that, I find it easy enough to reach out to others on the
            course, and to tutors facilitators. I also think that EDA makes it
            quite easy to be able to do this, to reach out for help when you're
            stuck.
          </p>
          <h3>description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3>
          <p>
            Feedback, and guidance and feedback on 'what is best practise' in
            this industry.
          </p>
          <h3>
            Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are
            committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau
            commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.
          </h3>
          <p>
            No specific committments, although friends, family, and time for
            myself to recharge are important things to me. However, I'm pretty
            good at scheduling time for work, and time out, And everything in
            between.
          </p>
          <h3>
            These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this
            list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are
            most clearly communicated.
          </h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy being creative, and re-structuring things, but I feel in
            this case for the purpose of the task, and clarity, answering in a
            list type fashion works really well for me.
