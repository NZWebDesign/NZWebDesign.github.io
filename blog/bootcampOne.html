              Foundations, done... Bootcamp ... lets go!!!!
            </h4>
            <p>
              So you've made it through foundations and bootcamp week has
              arrived. If you're reading this, and are wondering if a
              programming bootcamp is the right choice for you, you've probably
              come to the right place... lets dive on in over the next 9 weeks
              and find out what it's really like, from the perspective of
              someone who made the decision to go the bootcamp way.

            Foundations was cool, pretty cruisy, but still a lot of work. I'd
            done a bit of HTML and CSS prior to foundations and many of the
            concepts I was already familiar with but there were a few new topics
            introduced. <br />
            <br />
            I'd have liked more time to experiment with JavaScript coding, and
            if I was doing foundations again, I'd have got onto the more
            advanced JavaScript topics such as arrays and objects earlier on.
            But anyway, that's in the past, and we're at bootcamp.
            <br /><br />
            In the days leading up to bootcamp I was pretty excited about it,
            and perhaps a little nervous. I'd heard it was very full on, and all
            you did was code, eat, and sleep, - with the majority proportion of
            that time assigned to code.

            <p>
              Day one arrived, and flew by as did most of the week.
              Introductions took up the first half day, and then we were into
              pair coding and JavaScript kata exercises. I really didn't enjoy
              the JavaScript Kata exercises in foundations. I found myself
              spending more time trying to understand what the question was
              actually asking you to do, than figuring out how to code it. Along
              with this, it seemed like I didn't know much JavaScript at all!<br /><br />
              So you can imagine my 'annoyance' at more kata exercises! And then
              the same again on day two! Oh no, this isn't good. I'm over this!
              So I found myself walking home on Tuesday evening thinking about
              quitting. I figured, I can still teach myself everything, but in
              my own time, and at my own pace. Afterall, I've got the curriculum
              that outlines the topics we cover in the bootcamp, and You Tube is
              usually pretty good with tutorials these days. <br /><br />
              So there I was... strolling home and wondering at what point you
              can pull out of the course and still get it classed as an academic
              withdrawal when it comes to student loans and NCEA regulations. I
              knew there's be a point at which this was possible, so I figured
              I'd check it out at some stage. I decided I'd be at course on
              Wednesday and see how it went.

          <div>
            <h4 class="headerPadding">Day 3 - We built a (small) project</h4>

            <p>
              The topic, and highlight of day three is .... No more Kata!!!! I
              heard on day 3 (or at least it was around day 3(the days become a
              blur)) that we weren't to be doing any more Kata exercises. This
              was brilliant news!!! We started working on a small project, just
              a simple task in reality, but we worked in pairs, with an overall
              view of the aim of the project and built it ourselves. A much
              better way to work! No more "guess what the question actually
              means" kind of stuff!!!!! <br /><br />
              Day three was great, and the walk home so much more enjoyable!
              (oh, by the way, I use a lot of exclamation marks....!!) ! So the
              new plan was to hang around for week one, and that I should at
              least stay to the end of week two and then reacess how I was
              feeling about bootcamp.

              Day 4 and 5, were also a blur. They were good days, and at this
              point I thought I really should write, or journal, this journey.
              And then I thought, why don't I attempt in my spare time (what
              spare time?) to update the blog we started in foundations. And so
              here I am, a few days later, at lunchtime sitting in the sun
              outside, with the laptop on my knees tappity tap tap tapping away
              at the keyboard writing a blog.

            <h4 class="headerPadding">Overall impressions of week one</h4>

            <p>
              They say it's a journey. They say 'trust the process'. And I think
              they're right. Can I remember everything we covered in week one?
              No. Do I understand everything from week one? Far from it! But,
              the information is there, what I need to learn is there, and the
              experience is there. <br /><br />
              At some point later in the week I recalled a phrase from Andy
              Sterkowitz, a You Tuber who talks around the programming scene.
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/AndySterkowitz/featured"
                >(Check out his YOU TUBE channel.

            <p>
              Anyway... as I was saying... In one of his You Tube videos, Andy
              had said, when recalling his decision to become a programmer, that
              it was something he wanted to do, and it didn't matter if it took
              him 3 months, 6 months, a year, 3 years or five years, - the time
              didn't matter. What mattered is that if he stuck at it, he WOULD
              in fact eventually get there. <br /><br />
              My takeaway towards the end of week one was, that it didn't matter
              to me whether I 'pass' or 'fail' the course. And why should it?
              Why should I care? I'm here for the knowledge. I don't need to
              know it and understand it right now. Just take the knowledge, the
              information, and the journey, and store it away somewhere. Take
              notes, do the best you can for now, and in 10 weeks time (after
              bootcamp) you can study it, in your own time, at your pace, and
              fill in the gaps. And what's the hurry? I've got the remainder of
              the year to do this!

              You couldn't ask for a better team of people to spend the day
              with. The teachers are great. And the other students are great.
              The facilitators put a lot of energy into making the eda
              environment a friendly and awesome space. And the results show.
              There really isn't more to add in this paragraph. Words couldn't
              describe the positive, friendly, open, team oriented, environment
              that we're in, that has been created, and after only 5 days.

              I enjoy learning from You Tube tutorials. I think it's a style
              that works for me - hearing things repeated often, it all becomes
              familiar. I found myself going to You Tube a few times this week,
              to a few of my favourite channels.

              is another 'go to' channel. There's a few other channels I find
              useful which I might link to in future blogs. I started out
              bouncing around different channels when I started looking for
              tutorials, and I think that a list compiled with good channels
              could be useful. I've definitley now got my 'go to' channels..

              And one last thing... I won't apologise for spelling mistakes, and
              bad syntax, or lack of creativity in my blogs for the next 9
              weeks... they say bootcamp is full on... and they're right...
              there's no time to even tidy up blog posts or reword!!!! -So take
              it or leave it... stay safe, and enjoy the ride...
