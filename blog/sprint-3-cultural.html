          <h3 class="headerPadding">What's Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
          So you've made the leap into mindfulness, of living better, of being
          better, and you've heard about Emotional Intelligence. So what exactly
          is it? Emotional Intelligence is the ability to understand yourself.
          To understand yourself understanding yourself! To know yourself, to
          take time to reflect, to take time out, to understand and manage
          yourself. It is being in touch with your emotions - to perceive,
          evaluate and manage your emotions. By knowing and understanding
          yourself, you will know and understand others.

          <h3 class="headerPadding">How's it different to IQ?</h3>
          By contrast, IQ deals with Intelligence, the ability to apply logic,
          problem solve, to plan, learn new concepts and understand abstract
          ideas. In similar fashion to our ability to improve our IQ, we can
          also improve our EQ.

          <h3 class="headerPadding">But why EI?</h3>
          So why should I be so eager to get into this EI thing? Well, by
          understanding your emotions, and improving your emotional
          intelligence, research suggests you will be able to harness your
          emotions and feelings in positive ways to overcome challenges, reach
          those milestones, achieve goals in all aspects of life, communicate
          better, resolve conflict, and deal with stress - and who out there
          doesn't want those crucial advantages?!

          You heard it right here - it sure is worth investing time in building
          up your EI. Development of emotional intelligence can help you achieve
          and perform better at study, learning new things, at home, at work,
          and in social situations. It's often defined by the following four
          characteristics - Self Management, Self Awareness, and Relationship
          Management.

          <h3 class="headerPadding">EI is desireable</h3>
          Emotional Intelligence is ranked highly on the list of desirable
          attributes by employers seeking new employees. In a work environment a
          person with a high EI is often better equipped to deal with emotional
          and social situations that may arise at the work place. They fit in as
          both a learner and a leader. They work well in and with the team, and
          motivate the team as a whole to soar to new heights.

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-6 box1">
          <h3 class="headerPadding">Take care</h3>
          Another important aspect of EI is the ability to look after yourself.
          In an ever increasingly stressful world, the ability to understand
          yourself, to take time out, to reflect and recharge is highly sought
          after. All too often EI is neglected at the expense of hectic work
          hours, but before long the person is burnt out and is the next
          emotional breakdown. A strong EI can help a person manage and reduce
          stress, before it's too late. Stress has serious negative effects on a
          persons well being. This relates to both physical health and mental
          health. If nothing more, boost your EI for your own health and
          wellbeing.

          <h3 class="headerPadding">Who do you know?</h3>
          <p>
            The old saying, "it's not what you know, it's who you know..." often
            rings true in the world, a world in which networking is vitally
            important. A high EI can help a person understand themselves
            socially, and help them to make positive connections with other
            people walking the same path. Rather than battling along on ones
            own, connections can be made through positive social networking as a
            result of being aware, and of having a positve understanding of EI.

            So go forth, conquer the realm of Emotional Intelligence and you
            won't look back...
