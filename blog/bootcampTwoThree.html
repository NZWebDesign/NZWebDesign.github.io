              Week four already... but lets back it up...!!!!
            </h4>
            <p>
              We're into week four, bootcamp is flying by and we're well overdue
              for a review of week two...and three... <br /><br />
              So the idea of writing a blog at the end of every week, while
              sounding like a brilliant idea in theory, just isn't gonna happen
              in practice. Bootcamp is full on! But I knew it would be. I just
              didn't think it'd be full on full on. However, a blog every couple
              of weeks might just work... So here we are, about to begin week
              four, one third of the way through the course. I decided it would
              be a good time to reflect on the journey to date, the first third,
              and review the course so far. And again, I'll throw in the
              disclaimer -there's not time to proof read blogs for typos,
              syntax, or to be overly creative... so take it as it is, or leave
              it... enjoy the read, and may the odds be ever in your favour...

            Bootcamp is intense, the time flys by, there is so much content
            thrown at you. Every day you're on a new topic, building on what
            you've covered in previous days. It can seem overwhelming, and you
            wonder whether you're learning anything, whether all the new
            concepts will actually stick in your memory. You often feel like
            you're the only one who doesn't understand a new concept, that
            everyone else 'gets it' but it's only you that doesn't. But it's
            not. Sure, there are some people who do understand it straight away,
            who get the concepts pretty quickly, but there really are other
            people on the course who feel just like you do, feel like they are
            behind, don't understand and wonder, “how will I ever learn this!”

              Week one I felt like quitting, (see my previous blog) but week two
              and three come around quickly and you learn it's best just to go
              with the flow. It really doesn't matter if you don't understand
              something straight away, or if you're still struggling with
              something from the previous week. By week two I was into a routine
              of studying in the evenings, and staying behind to work after
              class with a few other people really pays off. One piece of advice
              I would give to anyone contemplating a bootcamp course, is to
              allow time after class in the evenings to do your own study. This
              is especially true if you learn best by having time on your own to
              slowly review new concepts, to build out projects yourself and put
              the new learnings into context.

              The following is a list of most of the topics we've covered in the
              first three weeks.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Node.js, NPM, REPL</li>
              <li>Test driven development</li>
              <li>Jest Testing</li>
              <li>Supertest, Cheerio</li>
              <li>Deployment to Heroku</li>
              <li>Testing Async Functions</li>
              <li>Handlebars – Templates, Partials, Layouts</li>
              <li>Server Side Rendering</li>
              <li>Express Router</li>
              <li>HTTP methods(GET, POST, PUT DELETE)</li>
              <li>Accepting User data with POST Routes, Testing Post Routes</li>
              <li>Sync vs Async functions, callbacks</li>
              <li>Databases, Sqlite, Knex</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              I feel that most of these topics are now reasonably familiar to
              me, however I'd still need to copy an example if I had to
              implement some of them. But it's just a matter of the more you do
              it, the more it will stick in memory. I definitely recommend
              having a personal project that you can build out, and incorporate
              each new learning into.

              I'm not sold on pair programming as a learning tool. A bootcamp
              day runs along the lines of, lecture for the first part of the
              morning, and then off to computers to work in a pair on the new
              learnings. I feel that this is not the optimal way to learn. I'd
              prefer the opportunity to have time to slowly go over the new
              information, without the added complexity of working with someone
              who may be ahead of you and ready to whizz through the material.
              <br /><br />
              I think it's a case of asking "what is this exercise about?" Is it
              about working with a pair, or is it about working on learning a
              new concept? - because it shouldn't be both. People learn in
              different ways, and I believe the opportunity should be there to
              accommodate different learning styles. <br /><br />
              Pair programming is an excellent way to work. I think it'd be my
              'go to' approach to programming when the opportunity is there ...
              but I think it probably works best when both partners in the pair
              are of a reasonably close ability level.

              Friday group projects began in week two, and these provide a great
              opportunity to practise the concepts learned during the week. I've
              found Fridays to be a good chance to go over things I still don't
              understand. The first Friday allowed me to get a grip on
              handlebars and express. The second Friday I used the opportunity
              to learn a little more about databases using sqlite and knex.
              Everyone really gets into the group spirit of the day, it's a fun
              time, and fun projects are created.

              There's so many terminal commands floating around in my head at
              the moment... npm start, run this, do that, migrate latest....
              I've started a cheat sheet list at the back of my notebook. It's
              definitley something I'd recommend, and if I had known on day one
              the number of terminal commands we'd be using I would have started
              the back of the notebook cheet sheat on day one! However, it's now
              filling out and a work in progress. While I'm talking cheat
              sheets,
              <a
                href="https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/"
                target="_blank"
                >here's a nifty little link</a
              >
              to a really good cheat sheet for flexbox.<br /><br />
              Another little tip that I've found useful, is to review the next
              days material the night before. Read anything in the handbook, and
              watch a You Tube video about it if you can locate one. If you're
              even a little bit familiar with the new concepts, the terminology,
              you'll have that feeling of, “ah yea, I know this, I know where
              this is going, I've got this” it makes the next days topics so
              much more understandable. Ok, so you'll still probably find the
              new learnings overwhelming, but just not as overwhelming as it
              would have otherwise been! <br /><br />
              So on that note, I'm off to read about tomorrows learnings... and
              to find a You Tube video about it to watch whilst enjoying a cold
              rum and coke....
